# Empirical-Method-in-Finance-Assignment-2
This report is divided into two parts. The first part aims to manipulate times series of various crypto-currencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero). We will first test for stationarity using the Dickey Fuller test, then check for co-integration among our crypto-currencies, and finally try to implement a pair-trading strategy using the re- sults found previously. The second part will aim to test again the stationarity of four new time series (i.e. US Dollar in trade weighted terms, Gold, the level of VIX index and Bitcoin), using the Augmented Dickey Fuller test and the Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) test. After transforming the non-stationary series into stationary ones, we will try to build a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model, by deciding the num- ber of lags using various information criteria model. Thereafter, we will determine the Impulse Response Function between our assets. Finally, we will estimate an uncon- strained and constrained VAR(1) model, and check whether there are any statistical differences between them. All the implementations will be done using Python.
